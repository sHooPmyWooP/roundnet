# Roundnet Player Management System

A Streamlit application for managing roundnet players, organizing playing days,
and generating balanced teams.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Functionality
- **Player Management**: Create players with skill levels (1-10 scale)
- **Playing Days**: Organize sessions where players gather to play
- **Team Generation**: Multiple algorithms to create balanced teams
- **Game Recording**: Track wins, losses, and ties (no scores needed)
- **Statistics**: Player performance and partnership tracking

### ðŸ”€ Team Generation Algorithms

1. **Random Assignment**: Completely random team pairing
2. **Skill Balanced**: Pairs high-skill with low-skill players
3. **Win Rate Balanced**: Pairs players based on historical win rates
4. **Partnership Balanced**: Minimizes frequent partnerships

### ðŸ’¾ Data Storage
- File-based JSON storage for persistence
- No database required - perfect for single-user scenarios
- Data stored in `data/` directory

## Usage

### Quick Start

1. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   uv run streamlit run src/roundnet/main.py
   ```

2. **Create sample data** (optional):
   - Click "Create Sample Data" on the dashboard
   - This adds players and playing days to explore the app

3. **Add your own data**:
   - Go to "Add Data" â†’ "Add Player" to create players
   - Set skill levels to help with team balancing
   - Create playing days for your sessions

4. **Organize a session**:
   - Go to "Manage Data" â†’ "Assign Players"
   - Select a playing day and assign players
   - Generate teams using your preferred algorithm
   - Record game results as you play

### Team Generation

1. Assign players to a playing day
2. Choose a team generation algorithm:
   - **Random**: For casual, unpredictable matchups
   - **Skill Balanced**: When you want competitive games
   - **Win Rate Balanced**: Based on historical performance
   - **Partnership Balanced**: To mix up frequent partnerships
3. Generate teams and start playing!
4. Record game results to build statistics

### Data Management

- **Players**: Add, edit skill levels, view statistics
- **Playing Days**: Create sessions, assign players, generate teams
- **Games**: Record results, view history
- **Statistics**: Track player performance and partnerships

## Development

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13+
- uv package manager

### Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync --extra dev

# Run the app
uv run streamlit run src/roundnet/main.py

# Run tests
uv run pytest

# Format code
uv run black src tests && uv run ruff check --fix src tests
```

### Key Changes from Previous Version

This refactor removes the concept of static teams in favor of:
- **Dynamic team generation** for each playing day
- **Player-centric approach** with skill levels
- **Partnership tracking** to see who plays together
- **Algorithm-based team balancing** for fair games
- **File-based persistence** instead of session storage

The new system is more flexible and realistic for casual roundnet groups where
teams change frequently.

## Data Models

### Player
- Name, skill level (1-10)
- Total games played and wins
- Calculated win rate

### Playing Day
- Date, location, description
- Assigned players
- Generated teams
- Algorithm used

### Game
- Playing day reference
- Team player IDs (2 players per team)
- Result (team A wins, team B wins, or tie)
- Duration and notes

### Partnership
- Tracks how often players play together
- Win rate when partnered
- Used for partnership balancing algorithm
